        We present two deep learning models developed 
        for detecting Covid-19 and viral pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Below, the
        architecture of a custom CNN model and a Transfer Learning model based on EfficientNetB1 are presented. 
        Additionally, the training process is discussed, showcasing the loss and accuracy functions used 
        with an evaluation of model performance.

        In the evaluation section, key metrics such as accuracy, F1 scores, and recall are analyzed 
        to determine the effectiveness of the two deep learning models developed for detecting Covid-19 
        and viral pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Additionally, the execution time for each model is 
        discussed to provide insights into their efficiency during inference. The models presented here 
        are marked in grey in the accompanying table, while the other models represent prior versions 
        that differ in either data preprocessing, model architecture, or both. Confusion matrices are also 
        provided to visualize the models' classification performance and identify areas of misclassification.
